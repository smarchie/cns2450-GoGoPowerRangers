Hello again, Mr. Gentile.

Our team has gotten together to discuss the requirements you gave us, and we have a few more follow up questions to make sure we are heading in the right direction. After reviewing the President's Challenge: Adult Fit Test, we're wondering if this is really a workout plan, or more of a "Fitness Tracker" to track the results of their fit test which they will complete on a weekly basis? Yes, that works for me.  You're looking at giving the user the ability to set which day they wish to complete each particular metric Yes, and then they mark the results once they've completed it Yes?

Do you have a current hosting service, or will we need to find one for you? Please find one.

What regions should we expect users to sign up from? (Utah, local service) Yes You'll need to take this into consideration with your SMS gateway service which will take over routing the text message to the proper provider. There are two options:
- 1. Pay for SMS gateway service Yes, let's pay for the service.
- 2. If the area is limited, we can program which provider/SMS gateway to send the text message to, but it will require additional maintenance as new cell providers are created. It will also have more maintenance if you choose to spread to a larger area.
