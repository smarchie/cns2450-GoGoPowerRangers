    There are still a few more things that need to be finished up, such as the line graphs and updating information put into the text boxes to the database. However, we feel like it's very close to being finished.  Please let us know what you think.


    Thank you,
    Team Go Go Power Rangers

Rachael, 

Thanks for all of your hard and good work.  It sounds great, and I look forward to seeing it when the log-in functions are up and running.  I did not see the screen shot attached to the e-mail.  Perhaps I am missing something.  Thus, I am not sure what would be good text for the Home tab.  I'm happy to let you pick whatever you'd like.  I trust you and your team!  Yes, those are definitely presidential colors.  Please feel free to use them!  

I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving weekend, too!

Sincerely, 

Nick Gentile :)
