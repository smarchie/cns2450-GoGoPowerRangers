Hello again, Mr. Gentile.

Our team has gotten together to discuss the requirements you gave us, and we have a few more follow up questions to make sure we are 
heading in the right direction. After reviewing the President's Challenge: Adult Fit Test, we're wondering if this is really a workout
 plan, or more of a "Fitness Tracker" to track the results of their fit test which they will complete on a weekly basis? You're looking
 at giving the user the ability to set which day they wish to complete each particular metric, and then they mark the results once 
they've completed it?

Do you have a current hosting service, or will we need to find one for you?

What regions should we expect users to sign up from? (Utah, local service) You'll need to take this into consideration with your 
SMS gateway service which will take over routing the text message to the proper provider. There are two options:
- 1. Pay for SMS gateway service
- 2. If the area is limited, we can program which provider/SMS gateway to send the text message to, but it will require additional 
maintenance as new cell providers are created. It will also have more maintenance if you choose to spread to a larger area.

Additional follow-up questions are in red below.

    Hello, Team Power Rangers!  Thanks for your mail.  As you might know, here are the basics of what I'm looking for:

        Needs to have a web interface the users can enter their weekly workout plan 

        Needs to allow anonymous users to create an account  
		--- We aren't entirely sure what you mean by "anonymous users". Since this is specifically set up to track information, 
		there will need to be at least one identifier for each user (most likely their email address which will also function 
		as their user ID). Therefore, we believe "anonymous" means that anyone can sign up for the site (no special invitation
		 required).

        Needs to have an android application that will notify the user they need to workout then shows them what that workout is for the day.   
		--- Below, you said that notifications will be sent weekly. Would the weekly notification lay out their day to day plan 
		(i.e. "This is your schedule for the week: Monday - Mile Walk; Tuesday - Push-Ups; Wednesday - Height, Weight, Waist 
		Measurement; Thursday - Half Sit-Ups, Sit and Reach")? Also, to fulfill the Android requirement, we are planning on having the 
		phone be notified via text message, as well as the user being able to pull the site up via the web on their Android. This would
		 also allow cross over to other smart phone devices with an internet connection as well.
         	Also, this is more effective because the functionality should not be affected by future Android releases, therefore it will not
		 require ongoing support from us, which will reduce your overall cost.

    4. Add a mechanism in the phone or webpage that allows the user to mark out which workout days he completed for the week.
	--- (link in text message to open site and log them in) 

    In terms of what I'd like you to track, please see the President's Challenge: Adult Fitness Test categories at adultfitnesstest.org.  
Familiarize yourself with the test requirements and tracking data, and then build the program accordingly.  Thanks!.  Here is a link to a PDF 
that specifically explains everything I'm looking for: http://www.adultfitnesstest.org/resources/datacollection.pdf

    Also, please see my responses in blue below:


    - NOTIFICATIONS
        - How do you want users to be notified?
    - text? (will allow for more than just Android users to participate) 
		=== Text is great.
    - What data do you want in the notification? 
		=== I'm cool with whatever you feel is best. 
			--- We could reminding them that it is a new week and that they have a full set of requirements to complete as well 
			as reminding them to go to the site and schedule the next week.
    - Should we allow them to opt in/out for text messaging? 
		=== Yes.
            - What do you want us to do if they have no phone? 
		=== Snail mail. 
			--- We would advise against this. Not only are you adding the extra expense of printing and mailing paper to your users, 
			but you also run into the issue of when to mail the letters out to get them to your users in time to be of actual use, 
			weird time zone issues (their schedule starts on Saturday, but they don't get their letter until Wednesday because they
			 live on the East Coast instead of the West Coast), no mail on weekends and holidays, what will happen during high traffic
			 postal times (such as Christmas), etc. Our suggestion is to use email. They are already going to be online to use the 
			tracker, and we're wanting to use email as the user name anyway. Why not use that as the secondary contact if they don't 
			list a cell phone number or choose to opt out of text messaging? As an added bonus, it is more environmentally friendly.

    - What version of Android did you want us to focus on? 
		=== the latest
    - How often do you want notifications sent? 
		=== weekly 
			--- We'll have it set to send out the text or email every week on Saturday.
    - USER / VIEW
    - Will you be giving us a database of users? === Nope.
    - What information do you want in the weekly history? === everything 
		--- What we're thinking is basically recreating the PDF, and they will have the ability to move up and down weeks. If they navigate
		 to a past week, it will populate the values in the boxes with what they originally entered. If they navigate to a future week, they
		 will be able to calendar which activity(-ies) they would like to do each day of that week.

		--- Do you want them to be able to change the values of the past weeks? (For example, they entered data wrong, and wanted to correct it?)


        - Should they be able to go back further than a week? === yes.  Let's do the whole time they've been in the program.
          - Do you only want to hold info for only one week? === No.  Hold it for the whole time they use the program.
        - What data do you want displayed? === Everything. 
		--- We'll display the data on the PDF on a weekly basis with the ability for the user to navigate to previous weeks.
              - How do you want it displayed? === Line graphs. 
			--- We're thinking that the metric being tracked (such as Mile Walk Time) will be in blue. When the user clicks on it, a line
			 graph will be displayed showing the time for each week. The same would be done for all other metrics (Sit-Ups, Push-Ups, 
			Heart Rate... etc). However, we get to the question of how you want to compare apples and oranges. For Aerobic Fitness, they get
			 a choice of what they want to do each week. How do you want to compare the Mile Walked vs 1.5-Miles Run Time?

        - Will you want to collect information that could require protection under privacy laws? === Yes.
    - If so, that would require a security certificate to protect user data? ($70/yr GoDaddy) === GoDaddy it is, then.
    - ADMIN
        - Do you need administrative access to user data/accounts? === Yes. 
		--- For admin rights, that would be to add/delete users, reset forgotten passwords, show trends (number of active/inactive users - 
		with inactive being they haven't checked in for at least 2 weeks). Can you think of anything else you would need?

            - What tools do you need for this access?
                - Reports? === Yes. 
			--- How do you want reports created for admin? Do you want the data compiled for all users (averages), or do you want to be 
			able to look at individual user's graphs? Did you want these as line graphs as well? What do you plan on doing with the reports?
			 (Knowing how you will use them will allow us to give you something useful)

                - User administration? === Yes.
                - Batch email/text messaging? === Yes.


As we go along, we will most likely have more questions for you. Because of the schedules and locations of our team members, email is the best way for us 
to communicate. Would email contact be acceptable for you? If not, what phone number would you like us to call you at?  
	=== I'm super busy, too, so e-mail contact is definitely best.  I appreciate your help with my product! ;)  T
		--- hank you for being willing to work so closely with us on this project! It will make it much easier for us to give you a product that 
		will meet your needs.

-- Go Go Power Rangers
